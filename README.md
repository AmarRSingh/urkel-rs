## Rust Implementation of the Urkel Tree

In progress implementation of an `urkel` (Base-2 Merkle) tree from the [Handshake project](https://github.com/handshake-org/urkel).

### What Works:
- insert/get/proof
- Basic store in place

### To Do:
- remove
- Store improvements
- Meta
- Rolling files
- Snapshot
- Tx batches

... The "todo" is larger than the "what works" ... :sweat_smile:
